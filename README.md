## General info
This project contains a simulation of a memory game consisting in finding every two identical pictures.
They have to be clicked in the same turn. One turn consists of two turned cards. 
There is no possibility to lose the game - it is over when there is no unturned card.
The lower score, the better - score means number of turns needed to finish the game.

## Technologies
Project is created with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery.

## Inspiration
This project is inspired by youtube javascript course (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edNqTubHUU0&list=RDCMUCzn6vAfspIcagLax1fck_jw&index=18). 
Due to this inspiration, it consists similarieties in code as well as my own ideas and solutions, such as rebuilding code to shorter and cleaner or adding new features.
